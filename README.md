# Server Firewall Configuration Report

## Rule Analysis

Below is an in-depth analysis of each rule implemented in our firewall configuration:

### 1. Allow SSH Access

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```

**Purpose**: This rule allows incoming SSH connections on the standard port 22.

**Justification**: SSH access is necessary for remote administration of the server. Without this rule, remote management would be impossible if the default policy is set to DROP or REJECT.

### 2. Allow Established and Related Connections

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
```

**Purpose**: This rule permits packets that are part of established connections or related to existing connections.

**Justification**: For proper network functionality, the server needs to receive responses to outgoing connections it initiated. This rule ensures that ongoing communications are not disrupted by the firewall.

### 3. Set Default Policy for Outgoing Traffic

```bash
sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
```

**Purpose**: Sets the default policy for outbound traffic to ACCEPT.

**Justification**: This allows the server to initiate outgoing connections without restrictions, which is generally safe since the threat model primarily focuses on incoming traffic.

### 4. Allow HTTP Traffic

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
```

**Purpose**: Permits incoming HTTP connections on the standard port 80.

**Justification**: Necessary for web server functionality, allowing users to access web content hosted on the server.

### 5. Allow HTTPS Traffic

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
```

**Purpose**: Allows incoming HTTPS connections on the standard port 443.

**Justification**: Required for secure web communications through SSL/TLS, enabling encrypted data transfer between clients and the server.

### 6. SYN Flood Protection

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn -m limit --limit 1/s -j ACCEPT
```

**Purpose**: Limits the rate of new TCP connections with the SYN flag to 1 per second.

**Justification**: Protects against SYN flood attacks, which attempt to consume server resources by sending a large number of SYN packets without completing the TCP handshake.

### 7. NULL Packet Protection

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL NONE -j DROP
```

**Purpose**: Drops packets with no TCP flags set (NULL packets).

**Justification**: NULL packets are often used in network reconnaissance and can indicate a port scan. Legitimate traffic should never have all TCP flags unset, making this an effective rule to block certain types of scanning activity.

### 8. Log Blocked Traffic

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -j LOG --log-prefix "BLOCKED: "
```

**Purpose**: Logs all packets that reach this rule (which would be all packets not matched by previous rules).

**Justification**: Provides visibility into blocked traffic, aiding in threat analysis and firewall rule optimization.

### 9. Log New Allowed Connections

```bash
sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -m state --state NEW -j LOG --log-prefix "ALLOWED: "
```

**Purpose**: Logs all new connections that are allowed through the firewall.

**Justification**: Helps monitor legitimate traffic and detect anomalies in access patterns, valuable for security auditing.

### 10. Save Firewall Rules

```bash
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules
sudo iptables-save | sudo tee /etc/iptables.rules > /dev/null
```

**Purpose**: Saves the current iptables configuration to a file.

**Justification**: Ensures rules can be restored after a system reboot.

### 11. Restore Rules at Boot

```bash
sudo sh -c "echo 'iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.rules' >> /etc/rc.local"
sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local
```

**Purpose**: Configures the system to restore iptables rules on boot.

**Justification**: Ensures continuous protection even after server restarts.

## Additional Protection Against Common Attacks

In addition to SYN flood protection, our firewall configuration addresses several other common types of network attacks. Below are additional rules implemented:

### Protection Against Port Scanning (Added Rule)

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,PSH,ACK,URG NONE -j DROP
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN FIN,SYN -j DROP
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN,RST -j DROP
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,RST FIN,RST -j DROP
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,ACK FIN -j DROP
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags PSH,ACK PSH -j DROP
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags ACK,URG URG -j DROP
```

**Purpose**: Blocks packets with invalid TCP flag combinations.

**Justification**: These rules protect against various stealth port scanning techniques (like XMAS scans, FIN scans, NULL scans) by dropping packets with illogical TCP flag combinations that would never occur in normal traffic but are often used in reconnaissance.
